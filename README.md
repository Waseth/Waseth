## Current Focus

I am currently building real-world projects that solve everyday problems, with a strong emphasis on understanding core JavaScript concepts through hands-on development.

My main project at the moment is Expensify, a personal finance tracker designed to help students manage income, expenses, and budgeting more effectively.

In parallel, I am preparing for a transition into React by first mastering underlying concepts in plain JavaScript, ensuring a solid foundation before moving into component-based frameworks.
